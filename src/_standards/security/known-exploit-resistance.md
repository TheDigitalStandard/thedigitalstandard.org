        procedure_html: >-
          <p>Browsers:</p><p>Identify publicly known vulnerabilities for each
          browser.</p><p>Use the original proof of concept code (if known) or
          devise custom code where necessary, to test the browser for the issue
          identified in the vulnerability notice.</p><p>Check if the browser is
          now protected from the identified
          vulnerabilities.</p><p>Apps:</p><p>Root/jailbreak the device,
          configure web proxy and network traffic monitor.</p><p>Launch target
          app, create accounts, sign-in, launch any activities available from
          user interface.</p><p>Monitor communication between the application on
          the device and any backend services.</p><p>Examine file system,
          database, and logs on the mobile device to determine if sensitive
          information is stored in a way that could lead to compromise of user
          data.</p><p>Connected Devices:</p><p>Check if using latest version of
          software.</p><p>Configure web proxy and network traffic
          monitor.</p><p>Create account and sign-in to the installed "out of the
          box" applications.</p><p>Launch any activities available from the user
          interface.</p><p>Monitor communication between the applications on the
          device, the device itself, and any backend services.</p><p>Examine
          file system, database, and logs to determine if sensitive information
          is stored in a way that could lead to compromise of user data."</p>
