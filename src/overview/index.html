      <p>The Digital Standard is built upon guiding values that are essential to building consumer confidence in technology. Each principle within The Digital Standard is presented with supporting criteria, indicators and methodologies to guide product teams, researchers and testers with evaluations.

        <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
          <p>The pace of technology is exciting and brings greater convenience to our lives, but also carries with it new problems as companies build products and services that don’t always reflect consumers’ best interests. Independent product testing has historically focused on how easy products and services are to use and their safety, quality, and cost. Today, such testing must also incorporate the individual and collective effects of products and services on privacy, fairness, and user control. The Digital Standard is designed to address these changing expectations, collaborate with key stakeholders to help define what is considered best practice and market-leading conduct, and influence the creation behind products and services before they are built and distributed in mass.</p>
