    <h2>Sensitive Data Collection</h2><p>Connected devices such as cameras are
    increasingly being used in the private sphere of the home and collect highly
    sensitive information including voice and visual recordings of the home and
    the area immediately around a private residence. However, as multiple

    have shown, many of these products are built without adequate security.</p>
