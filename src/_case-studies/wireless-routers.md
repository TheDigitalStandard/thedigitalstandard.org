    <p>Today&rsquo;s home network may include a wide range of wireless devices,
    from computers and phones to IP Cameras, smart TVs, and connected
    appliances. The router usually is the center of the home network. It&rsquo;s
    a layer (even the only layer) that stays between your devices and the
    internet. A secure router will help protect your devices &ndash; and your
    information &ndash; from compromise. Therefore, the data privacy and
    security of the router is an extremely important aspect to determine if a
    router is good or bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer Reports has been publishing <a
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/wireless-routers.htm">router
    ratings</a> for years, but we've now made the tests tougher, screening for
    approximately 60 different indicators of good security and privacy
    practices, along with about 100 data points used to evaluate speed, ease of
    use, and other characteristics.</p>

    <p>The primary purpose is to investigate the most popular routers in the
    data privacy and security aspect, to generate ratings for each router in
    accordance with criteria/indicators of the <a
    href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a>.
    Specifically, we evaluate: 1. how easy the malicious person can compromise
    data confidentiality, system integrity, and function availability; 2. how
    well manufacture/service providers do in data collection, data retention,
    data use, and data sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>We performed a full round of Digital
    Standard testing on 38 wireless routers and it is now displayed on our site
    on the <a
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/wireless-routers/ratings-overview/">wireless
    router ratings page</a>. The final ratings integrates data privacy and data
    security into the overall rating. We reported the test result highlights in
    this article here: <a

    <h2>Consumer Reports Article:<strong> </strong></h2><p><a
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/wireless-routers/wireless-routers-lack-basic-security-protections/">Many
    Wireless Routers Lack Basic Security Protections, Consumer Reports' Testing
    Finds</a>. This article highlights new testing which shows the important
    differences in how routers from popular brands handle digital security. It
    covers how CR tests routers on a long list of characteristics. For instance,
    we check whether a router protects against known security vulnerabilities
    and whether certain questionable networking protocols are turned off by
    default. We examine the routers&rsquo; privacy policies to see whether
    manufacturers explain how they handle consumer data. Of course, we also
    measure how quickly routers transmit data over a variety of distances. After
    all, a safe and secure router won&rsquo;t do you much good if it&rsquo;s too
    slow to reliably stream Netflix.&nbsp;</p><h3>Key security findings includes
    topics on:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Protection against multiple failed login
    attempts</li><li>Weaknesses in passwords</li><li>Networking protocols turned
    on by default&nbsp;</li><li>How routers handled firmware updates, which are
    vital for the home&rsquo;s network security</li><li>Router firmware
    updates</li></ul><h3>Key privacy findings include topics
    on:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Privacy policies and their mentions of what
    manufacturers might collect from users such as network speeds, the name of
    an internet service provider, and how much data people are transmitting to
    the web.</li></ul><ul><li>Disabling features not inuse (e.g. Universal Plug
    and Play)</li></ul>
