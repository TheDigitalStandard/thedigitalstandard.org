              <h2>Unclear legal agreements:</h2><p>Peer-to-peer payment app providers
    deserve credit for designing simple and easy-to-use applications that belie
    their underlying technological and financial sophistication. But that
    simplicity smooths over more than just technical wizardry. It also hides a
    thicket of overlapping and uncoordinated legal agreements, financial
    regulations, and consumer protections. It&rsquo;s almost impossible for
    consumers&mdash;even the rare ones who read user agreements&mdash;to
    understand their rights and obligations in the event of error or financial
    fraud.</p><h2>Misdirected payments:</h2><p>The CR study found it can be
    alarmingly easy to make the mistake of a misdirected payment, and that
    consumers may not know they can't necessarily reverse such payments. Nor do
    they know that in most cases, providers won't help if the recipient refuses
    to return the misdirected funds.</p><h2>Fraud:</h2><p>Another issue is
    outright fraud. Thieves are increasingly exploiting consumer enthusiasm
    for&mdash;and trust in&mdash;P2P services. If you or a family member is
    tricked into sending money to a scammer via P2P, the law doesn&rsquo;t
    require P2P services to return or help recover the
    funds.</p><h2>Privacy:</h2><p>Payment apps typically have access to very
    detailed and illuminating information about our purchase habits, data that
    could be profitably used or sold. However, consumers have very little
    information about what app vendors are doing with this data, or which ones
    have the best practices.</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered from CR Article: <a

              <h2>Full testing on 5 mobile P2P services:</h2><p>In light of the quick rise
    of P2P&mdash;and its potential financial and privacy risks&mdash;Consumer
    Reports tested five mobile P2P services to see how they stacked up for user
    protections. This included ratings that spanned privacy and security,
    usability, safety and convenience. Note: We originally had 6 (Snap Cash) but
    it was discontinued after the testing was done but before CR released its
    results</p><p>In our first-ever test-based ratings of P2P mobile services,
    CR rated Apple Pay the highest overall, with excellent or very good marks in
    the key consumer-protection measures of payment authentication and data
    privacy. Apple Pay is designed to limit how much data Apple collects about
    consumer spending, and its policies most clearly prohibited secondary use or
    sharing of personal information. Apple's overall rating was significantly
    higher than for the other services we tested: Venmo, Square's Cash App,
    Facebook P2P Payments in Messenger, and Zelle. We rated each of the five
    services good enough to use. The ratings are visualized below:&nbsp;<br

              <h2>Consumer Reports ratings article and in-depth review:</h2><p><a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-payments/mobile-p2p-payment-services-review/">Why
    Apple Pay Is the Highest-Rated Mobile P2P Payment Service</a>. This article
    highlighted key problems and fixes to better protect themselves, urging
    immediate action on the part of policymakers and P2P service providers. The
    article also shared how app services responded to the
    investigation:&nbsp;</p><h3>Zelle adopts practice to confirm recipients
    before transferring money:</h3><p>Zelle, a service used by about 150 U.S.
    banks and credit unions, was rated good overall. But it was the only service
    that ranked below average on data security and data privacy, which were
    weighted heavily in our ratings. The Zelle app lacks features that keep you
    from accidentally sending money to the wrong person. That could happen if
    you mistype a phone number.&nbsp;</p><p>Contacted by CR for <a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-payments/mobile-p2p-payment-services-review/">this
    report</a>, Zelle said it would soon adopt the practice of asking senders to
    confirm recipients before transferring the money, the current practice of
    some banks and credit unions that offer the Zelle service.</p><h3>Zelle app
    makes changes for misdirected payments:</h3><p>In mid-September, the Zelle
    mobile peer-to-peer service was updated by its operator, Early Warning
    Services, to add measures to help prevent users from inadvertently sending
    money to the wrong person.</p><p>Consumer Reports tested the Zelle
    stand-alone app and found that it now includes a pop-up warning for users
    that send money to someone not in their contacts. When CR first tested the
    stand-alone Zelle app earlier this year, we found it lacked that security
    feature.&nbsp;</p><p>An Early Warning spokesperson said the new security
    pop-ups also are available on Zelle apps that are sponsored by individual
    banks. The spokesperson said participating banks are required to display a
    message that says, "Money should only be sent to people you trust." It also
    says, "Once payments are sent, they cannot be reversed."</p><h2>Consumer
    Reports article:</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-payments/peer-to-peer-payments-are-generally-safe-but-consumers-must-be-aware-of-risks/">Peer-to-Peer
    Payments Are Generally Safe, But Consumers Must Be Aware of Risks</a>
    outlining steps that users, providers and policymakers should take to
    alleviate privacy and security concerns: The article reported that most
    companies are investing significant resources in security and allow users to
    set up extra layers of security. But nearly all of them could do more to
    keep users safe.</p><p>In particular, they could design their apps to
    &ldquo;default&rdquo; to the highest security level, meaning users would
    have to actively chose to opt out. Instead, Venmo, Square's Cash App, and
    Facebook Payments in Messenger require no password, PIN, or fingerprint for
    repeat access to the app or to initiate a transaction when their default
    security settings are in place. Only one provider, Apple, requires users to
    confirm a payment before it is sent.</p><h2>Written
    Testimony:</h2><p>Consumer Reports&rsquo; Senior Policy Counsel, Christina
    Tetreault submits to U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services
    Committee Task force on Financial Technology. <a target="_blank"

    recommendations</a> include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Congress should create a
    strong federal floor of consumer payments protections.</li><li>Congress
    should pass strong privacy legislation, including curbs on data
    collection.</li></ul><p>In addition to submitting written testimony, CR
    testified in person. We also presented these results to the Federal Reserve
    Board Mobile Payments Working Group in Boston (June 2019), at the
    Clearinghouse's annual meeting in Fall 2018, and in presentations to at
    least a half dozen more other industry and consumer
    organizations.</p><h2>Consumer 101 video:</h2><p>Consumer Reports expert,
