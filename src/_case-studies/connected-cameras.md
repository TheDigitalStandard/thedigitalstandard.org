    <h2>Sensitive Data Collection</h2><p>Connected devices such as cameras are
    increasingly being used in the private sphere of the home and collect highly
    sensitive information including voice and visual recordings of the home and
    the area immediately around a private residence. However, as multiple
    reports of connected camera hacking and incidents of unauthorized access
    have shown, many of these products are built without adequate
    security.</p><h2>Exposure of account credentials</h2><p>There were a series
    of hacks and vulnerabilities that have affected Ring security cameras and
    video doorbells, exposing account credentials. Reports surfaced of multiple
    Ring accounts being hacked through credential stuffing. Back in November
    2019, it was revealed that Ring video doorbells contained a vulnerability
    that exposed WiFi network names and passwords. And last May, The Information
    reported a vulnerability that let individuals stay logged into Ring accounts
    even after a password change. At the end of December 2019, it was also
    reported that Wyze had suffered a breach of their customer data, leaving
    customers open to unauthorized access of their cameras.</p>

    <p>Across 14 home security connected cameras, Consumer Reports performed a
    round of full testing across these devices in accordance with
    criteria/indicators of the Digital Standard. The result of this testing was
    a set of Consumer Reports ratings for home security cameras available to
    consumers (image left) which incorporated data privacy and security
    categories. Consumer Reports also reviewed cameras in 2019.</p>

    <h2>Created Campaign Strategy</h2><p>In order to organize our efforts, the
    Consumer Reports team strategized a campaign by doing research on reported
    hacking incidents in the month of December 2019, reviewed the IP camera
    testing report from August 2019 and assembled a list of company contacts at
    the 25 manufacturers of connected camera products we have reviewed.</p>
