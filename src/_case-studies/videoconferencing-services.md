<p>As of mid-April 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html">95%
of the American population</a> are under orders to stay home. This new
reality <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/video-conferencing-apps-surge-coronavirus/">has
triggered a spike</a> in people accessing videoconferencing services. Zoom
has received a significant amount of attention, but other major companies
with competing services &mdash;Cisco, Google, and Microsoft&mdash; require
similar scrutiny.</p><p>Consumers are caught in a difficult place. For
millions of people, a videoconferencing service is the lifeline they need to
stay employed, to access medical care, to keep in touch with family and
friends. For many students &mdash; from pre-K through graduate school
&mdash; videoconferencing, though not the only method of teaching
interaction (e.g. one way video instruction or sending activities via
email), is a central part of their education and connecting with classmates
and teachers. If a person does not want to use a videoconferencing service
out of privacy and security concerns, they may not be able to access
classes, show up for a job, gain access to medical care or maintain contact
with friends and family.</p><p>Consumers should be able to trust that
companies will provide clear, simple language that shows how they respect
and protect user privacy and security. There was an opportunity in the
market for videoconferencing services to distinguish themselves as a leader
in respecting user privacy as a core foundation of their business. Consumers
deserve access to these services without sacrificing the privacy or security
of their personal data and information.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered

<p>Through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/skype-meet-webex-videoconference-privacy-845bc8360fd3">a
comparative analysis</a>, we examined the privacy policies for three popular
videoconference tools: Webex from Cisco, Skype from Microsoft, and Meet from
Google. This comparative analysis was designed to identify potential risks
and highlight areas where a lack of clarity creates doubt about how a
company protects the privacy of its users. . This analysis does not imply
every company is exploiting every possible loophole.&nbsp;</p><p>We
conducted a comparative analysis on privacy policies since privacy policies
create publicly defined commitments about a company&rsquo;s values. If
something is true in the privacy policy, it should be true in the product,
the user experience and the technical architecture behind the service. There
are areas where the actual intentions of a company and their current daily
practices are not accurately captured in their privacy policies.</p><p>The
criteria used for these areas for improvement are <a target="_blank"
rel="noopener"
href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/comparative-analysis-rubric-2d999ed0fa69">defined
in this document</a>. For specific details on the services and a breakdown
of these privacy policies, we created more granular overviews of <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/skype-teams-microsoft-policy-review-299bd1403c4b">Skype</a>,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"

and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/webex-cisco-policy-review-3608a1eafddf">Webex</a>.
These recommendations were framed in a way that is broadly applicable to any
platform that offers video conferencing features.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sent a letter to Company CEOs highlighting 10 recommendations and
changes:</h2><p>Based on the analysis, our policy team reached out to
Google, Cisco and Microsoft, gave them an opportunity to make needed
improvements and sent a letter to the company CEOs. The goal of this work
was to ensure that these services make clear, strong commitments in the
privacy policies to protect people who use and rely on these services. The
letter included recommendations covering the following
topics:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Personal Data Leak.</li><li>First Party Data
Collection.</li><li>Data Enhancement.</li><li>Third Party
Access.</li><li>Implications of Employer or School Sponsorship of
Service.</li><li>Data Deletion and Retention.</li><li>Differentiation
Between Data Collected from Hosts Versus from
Participants.</li><li>Information Used for Product Development.</li><li>Data
that Can be Sold or Shared as Part of a Transaction.</li><li>Access to Data
for Machine Learning, AI Analysis, or Human Review.</li></ol><h2>Consumer

the key recommendations for users to stay more private in video chats
including picking one platform, using outside privacy tools, assume
you&rsquo;re being recorded and just make a regular phone
call.</p><h2>Manufacturer engagement:&nbsp;</h2><p>In coordination with
publishing the findings from the comparative analysis and sending a letter
to the CEOs of Cisco, Google, and Microsoft, the Advocacy team also emailed
contacts within each organization requesting a meeting to discuss the
findings. We met with all three companies, with results summarized
below.</p><ul><li>Cisco was the fastest to respond, and <a target="_blank"
rel="noopener"
href="https://www.consumerreports.org/video-conferencing-services/cisco-clarifies-privacy-policy-for-webex-videoconferencing/">made
some changes</a> in short notice. These changes included adding clearer
links to relevant policies from the sign up pages for WebEx, and providing a
more accessible path to a document that provides greater detail about the
data collection and use related to WebEx.</li><li>Initial meetings with both
Microsoft and Google allowed both companies to get a clearer understanding
of the areas for improvement that were outlined in the comparative analysis,
but as of mid-June 2020, neither Google or Microsoft has followed up with
details about actions or improvements they have taken in response to this
work.</li></ul><h2>Press release:</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
