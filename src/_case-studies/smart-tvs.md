    <h2>Smart TVs can monitor watching behavior:</h2><p>Smart TVs are sets that
    connect to the internet, making it easy to stream videos from services such
    as Hulu and Netflix. Most smart TVs are equipped with &ldquo;automated
    content recognition&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACR&rdquo;) that scans images on
    viewers&rsquo; screens and identifies the content by comparing it to its own
    known videos, shows, and movies. In doing so, smart TVs can generate a
    detailed log of what consumers watch &mdash; often without clear notice or
    permission. In addition, consumers often cannot buy a TV that is not smart
    these days, thus making them more likely to be creeped on by their TV
    manufacturer.</p><h2>Data sharing to advertising companies:
    &nbsp;</h2><p>Other researchers have found much the same thing. <a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ren-imc19.pdf">In
    one study</a>, researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College
    London looked at smart TVs and other internet-connected devices and found
    that many of them sent data to Amazon, Facebook, and Doubleclick, Google's
    advertising business. Nearly all the TVs sent data to Netflix even if the
    app wasn't installed or the owner hadn't activated it.</p><h2>Many channels
    to share more data:</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/publications/tv-tracking-ccs19.pdf">Another
    study</a>, by researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago, looked
    not at TVs but at two popular set-top streaming devices from Roku and Amazon
    Fire TV. More than 2,000 channels were offered, and the researchers found
    trackers on 69 percent of Roku channels and 89 percent of Amazon Fire TV
    channels. The numbers are likely to be the same for smart TVs that have Roku
    or Amazon platforms built in.</p><h2>Potential hacks or security
    issues:</h2><p>The smart TV itself may be subject to hacks or other security
    issues due to the connected nature of the product. Consumers often
    don&rsquo;t know about how much data is collected about them while they use
    their tv and they often don&rsquo;t know how or if they can change how much
    they share. Additionally, consumers have no way of evaluating the security
    of their smart tv. As part of one of our first case studies under the
    Digital Standard, we looked to evaluate smart tvs in order to respond to
    these two concerns.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered from <a

    <h2>Full testing:</h2><p>In February 2018, we performed our first ever tests
    on TVs using the Digital Standard. In 2020, we conducted another update on
    2019 smart TVs in accordance with criteria of the <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener" href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital
    Standard</a>. These<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/tvs/ratings-overview/">
    generated new scores on the ratings site</a>, incorporating data privacy and
    data security into our overall rating.&nbsp;</p><h2>Qualitative
    interviews:</h2><p>In March 2020, we conducted <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/tvs/consumers-struggle-with-smart-tv-privacy-settings/">a
    recent study</a> with 16 volunteers around the country showing that people
    may not understand what information their TVs collect, or know about
    settings they can use to boost their privacy. The project was part of CR's
    consumer experience and usability research program, in which we study how
    consumers interact with products to better inform our lab testing. In this
    case, a user-interface expert interviewed participants in an online
    environment as they clicked through screen shots taken from <a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/tvs/smart-tv-systems-pros-cons/">smart
    TV platforms</a>. The participants helped us evaluate the type of smart TV
    platform they used at home, performing tasks such as finding privacy
    policies and the right settings for cutting down on data collection. Like
    laptops and smartphones, modern TVs collect consumer information, and the
    TVs come with privacy disclosures in their user agreements, which are
    typically displayed during the setup process. None of the volunteers in our
    study had read through an entire user agreement when they set up their
    TV.</p><h2>Smart TV Digital Standard Test Protocol:</h2><p>Along with this,

              <h2>Consumer Reports Article:</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/televisions/samsung-roku-smart-tvs-vulnerable-to-hacking-consumer-reports-finds/">Samsung
    and Roku Smart TVs Vulnerable to Hacking, Consumer Reports Finds</a>. This
    February 2018 report highlighted that our tests found that millions of smart
    TVs can be controlled by hackers exploiting easy to-find security
    flaws&mdash;this includes Samsung televisions, models made by TCL, and other
    brands that use the Roku TV smart-TV platform. Moreover, the TVs collect
    detailed information on their users, which raises privacy
    concerns.&nbsp;</p><h2>Some key findings shared in the report
    include:</h2><h3>Overcollection by design.</h3><p>The platforms are designed
    for people to race through their TV&rsquo;s setup, agreeing to everything,
    and a constant stream of viewing data will be collected through automatic
    content recognition. The technology identifies every show you play on the
    TV&mdash;including cable, over-the-air broadcasts, streaming services, and
    even DVDs and Blu-ray discs&mdash;and sends the data to the TV maker or one
    of its business partners, or both.</p><h3>A choice between your data or your
    internet.</h3><p>People can limit data collection, but they may lose
    functionality. For example, if people turn off ACR monitoring while still
    agreeing to the set&rsquo;s basic privacy policy, that may keep them from
    getting recommendations (&ldquo;You liked &lsquo;Westworld.&rsquo; Have you
    checked out &lsquo;Godless&rsquo;?&rdquo;) Even the basic privacy policies
    may ask for the right to collect information on your location, which
    streaming apps you click on, and more. If you say no to these basic
    policies, the sets revert to old-fashioned dumb TVs: without the ability to
    stream anything from Amazon, Netflix, or other web-based
    services.</p><h3>All-or-nothing privacy policy.</h3><p>The Sony television
    was the only one that required people to agree to a privacy policy and terms
    of service to complete the setup of the TV. The set uses Google&rsquo;s
    Android TV platform, and consumers have to click yes to Google agreements,
    even if they don&rsquo;t plan to connect to the internet. That could be a
    frustrating thing to discover only after you&rsquo;d bought the big-screen
    TV at the store, lugged it home, and maybe mounted it to a wall. Even though
    you can&rsquo;t skip the Google privacy policy, you can say no to the user
    agreements from Sony itself and from Samba TV, a provider of ACR
    technology.</p><h2>Additional awareness:&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Home security
