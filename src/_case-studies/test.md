  <h2>Sensitive Data Collection</h2><p><br />Connected devices such as cameras
  are increasingly being used in the private sphere of<br />the home and collect
  highly sensitive information including voice and visualrecordings<br />of the
  home and the area immediately around a private residence. However, as
  multiple<br />reports of connected camera hacking and incidents of
  unauthorized access have shown,<br />many of these products are built without
  adequate security.</p><h2>Exposure of account credentials</h2><p><br />There
  were a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ring-doorbells-had-vulnerability-leaking-wi-fi-login-info-researchers-found/">series
  of hacks and vulnerabilities </a>that have affected Ring security<br />cameras
  and video doorbells, exposing account credentials. <a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"
  href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/video/terrifying-video-familys-hacked-ring-camera-system-67704081">Reports
  surfaced</a> of<br />multiple Ring accounts being hacked through <a
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-keep-dumping-ring-credentials-online-for-the-giggles/">credential
  stuffing</a>. Back in November<br />2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ring-doorbells-had-vulnerability-leaking-wi-fi-login-info-researchers-found/">it
  was revealed</a> that Ring video doorbells contained a vulnerability that <a
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/ring-patches-total-lack-of-password-security-during-setup/">exposed<br
  />WiFi network names and passwords</a>. And last May, <a
  href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-latest-security-device-let-people-spy-on-you">The
  Information reported</a> a<br />vulnerability that let individuals stay logged
  into Ring accounts even after a password<br />change. At the end of December
  2019, it was also reported that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/tech/wyze-data-breach/index.html">Wyze
  had suffered a<br />breach</a> of their customer data, leaving customers open
  to unauthorized access of their<br />cameras.</p><h2>Security
  Breaches</h2><p><br />Attackers have openly viewed home security systems and
  baby monitorfeeds, and<br />have even spoken with residents, including young
  children. In December 2019,<br />Consumer Reports reported on <a
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.consumerreports.org/hacking/ring-doorbell-accounts-may-be-vulnerable-to-hackers/">a
  series of security breaches</a>. The news mainly on<br />Amazon Ring products,
  where hackers compromised devices, harassed homeowners<br />and sometimes
  children. While much news coverage was focused on Ring, it was<br />possible
  that other popular connected camera brands could have similar<br
  />vulnerabilities.</p><p>These issues don&rsquo;t just plague Ring devices
  either. In January 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/23/how-nest-designed-keep-intruders-out-peoples-homes-effectively-allowed-hackers-get/">there
  were reports<br />of Nest cameras being hacked</a>, again through credential
  stuffing. In response to the<br />number of hacks and vulnerabilities,
  Consumer Reports initiated product testing across<br />14 connected camera
  products.</p><h4><em>[Excerpts gathered from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
