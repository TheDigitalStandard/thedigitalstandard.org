  <p><strong>Mental health apps growing in popularity: </strong>&nbsp;App-based
  mental health counseling is a large and growing industry. These apps accounted
  for $587.9 million in 2018 and are expected to generate up to $3.9 billion in
  annual revenue by 2027, according to <a

  Markets Insights</a>, a consumer demand and trends firm. Due to greater
  awareness related to the significance of mental health, U.S. and Canadian
  consumers made up the majority of the global market in
  2018.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Increased anxiety and tumult, harms not evenly
  distributed: </strong>Recent events like the global coronavirus pandemic, the
  resulting economic crisis, and large scale protests related to the Black Lives
  Matter movement, have spotlighted rising mental health related harms with
  marginalized and vulnerable populations. And increased anxiety and upheaval
  causes both physical and psychological symptoms and <a
  href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322510#:~:text=Outlook,health%20conditions%2C%20such%20as%20depression">can
  be very distressing</a>. Mental health applications collect sensitive
  information that can create damaging, irreversible impacts on individuals if
  shared with third parties, including social stigmatization and additional
  barriers to future opportunities. These applications can collect data around
  topics such as anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorders, eating
  disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Finally, the pandemic has
  exposed disparities in the U.S. mental health system, <a

  the Center for American Progress</a>. People with mental health disabilities

  leaks: </strong>In addition, there are documented data leaks with mental
  health applications. Investigative journalists have highlighted issues around
  excessive data sharing with the argument that apps<a

  can either sell subscriptions to services or sell data</a>. Privacy concerns
  about mental health apps <a
  href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/mental-health-apps-highlight-need-for-regulation/">have
  highlighted the need for improved regulation</a> on these apps, marketed to
  people with anxiety, autism and depression. Other research highlighted how
  &ldquo;the majority of the top-ranked mental health apps for depression and
  smoking cessation&rdquo; share user data <a

process_html: "<p><strong>Data Testing: </strong>We ran a static analysis of each Android application. We also worked with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.appcensus.io/\">AppCensus</a>, a company that analyzes app behavior for privacy and security issues, to do an automated analysis of the apps. This research process involved an inspection of the following items:</p><ul><li>Permissions: What access to data and features was requested, and what was actually used?</li><li>Third Party SDKs: What third-party software is bundled with the app when a user installs it, and what role does it play in app behavior?&nbsp;</li><li>Data recipients: Which entities (companies, services, etc.) receive information from the app, and which security and privacy methods / policies do they observe or not</li><li>Personal information: What identifiers (Android ID, Advertising ID, etc.) from the phone are transmitted by the app, and where are these identifiers sent?</li><li>We used the following Android app binaries:&nbsp;<ul><li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterhelp\">BetterHelp version 1.63</a></li><li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.moodpath.android\">MindDoc version 4.2.0</a></li><li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.moov.five\">Sanity &amp; Self version 3.0.6396</a></li><li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkspace.talkspaceapp\">Talkspace version 3.30.80</a></li><li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bot.touchkin\">Wysa version 2.4.1</a></li><li>Youper version 8.04.000</li><li><a href=\" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sevencupsoftea.app\">7 Cups version 4.6.9</a></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Design analysis (UX + UI):</strong> The user experience, user interface design analysis involved a manual, thorough review of all of the user-interfacing elements of the applications.

We found the answer to this through Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</li><li>Did we see the app share data ONLY with companies named in the privacy policy? We used the AppCensus service and performed static analysis with MobSF to collect this information.&nbsp;</li><li>Can you delete your data? We found the answer to this through the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</li><li>Can you delete your data easily, right from the app? We found the answer to this through a manual, UX/UI design review</li><li>Does the app ask permission before using your data for research? We found the answer to this through a manual, UX/UI design review and through document review.</li><li>Can you opt-out of data research projects? We found the answer to this through Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and a manual, UX/UI design review.</li><li>We referred to the following privacy policies:&nbsp;<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com/privacy\_\">BetterHelp, updated on September 11, 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"https://mymoodpath.com/en/privacy-policy/\">MindDoc, no update date, reviewed on November 23, 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sanityandself.com/privacy/\">Sanity &amp; Self, updated on January 31, 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.talkspace.com/public/privacy-policy\">Talkspace, updated on January 1, 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"https://legal.wysa.io/privacy-policy\">Wysa, updated on November 19, 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youper.ai/privacy-policy\">Youper, updated on February 20, 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.7cups.com/Documents/PrivacyPolicy\">7 Cups, updated on May 15, 2020</a></li></ul></li></ul>"

  <p>CR sent a letter on December 17, 2020 to seven companies that operate
  mental health applications: BetterHelp, Moodpath, Sanity &amp; Self,
  Talkspace, Wysa, Youper and 7 Cups. Based on a review of the policies of these
  applications, CR is urging the companies to raise the standard of privacy and
  transparency for their services.</p><p>We provided the four recommendations
  below to the companies:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Clearly explain procedures used
  for de-identification of data used for research. Identifiable data should not
  be shared except at the consumer&rsquo;s direction.</strong></p><p>We advocate
  for companies to improve clarity on research for data sharing especially
  around how they define &ldquo;anonymized data.&rdquo; Companies should be
  explicit about what processes they use to de-identify data. We highlight this
  to help prevent people from being reidentified.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Ensure
  that privacy awareness and clear explanations how data is being used should be
  part of important decision points so the user is made aware that the data is
  aware of potential consequences.</strong></p><p>Companies should not overwhelm
  people with superfluous information or choices. Wherever possible, app default
  settings should be that your privacy is protected and users should not have to
  worry about managing this on their own. However, if there are choices to be
  made or information someone should be aware of, they should be presented in a
  clear and straightforward way.</p><p><strong>3. Adhere to platform guidelines
  that are in place to protect people&rsquo;s privacy.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>App
  developers should ensure that their apps meet the guidelines laid out in
  Android developer documentation, such as <a
  href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids"><em>Best
  Practices for Unique Identifiers</em></a> which recommends avoiding the use of
  identifiers like the Android ID (SSAID). App developers should also make sure
  that the libraries (SDKs) they embed within their apps meet their own
  expectations for data collection, and that they are configured
  accordingly.</p><p><strong>4. Transparently disclose the service providers
  that receive data when people use your apps.</strong></p><p>We recommend that
  companies are more transparent in their privacy policies about the service
  providers that receive data as a way to increase company accountability. It
  may not be feasible to list every service provider or institution they share
  anonymized data with, but more transparency will contribute to a healthier
  ecosystem by allowing external parties to analyze and verify companies&rsquo;
  actions.</p><p>We published a <strong>full research study</strong> that
  provides additional information about our investigation. We also published a
  <strong>letter to the companies</strong>, a <strong>short memo of findings and
  recommendations</strong> and a <strong>blog post</strong>.</p>
