<h2>Context:</h2><p>Fertility or menstrual cycle trackers have been used by
nearly a third of women in the U.S., according to a recent Kaiser Family
Foundation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://www.kff.org/other/poll-finding/kff-health-apps-and-information-survey/">survey</a>.
They are part of the burgeoning market for &ldquo;femtech,&rdquo; which are
technology-based products and services focused on women&rsquo;s health. The
market for all digital tools for women&rsquo;s health needs&mdash;such as
apps for personalized nutrition advice, weight-loss coaching, and high-tech
breast pumps that record when and how much is pumped&mdash;could be worth as
much as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://ww2.frost.com/frost-perspectives/femtechtime-digital-revolution-womens-health-market/">$50
billion by 2025</a>, according Frost &amp; Sullivan, a research and
consulting firm.</p><h2>Sensitive data collection:</h2><p>Fertility or
menstrual cycle trackers, broadly categorized as reproductive health
&nbsp;trackers, can be used for a wide variety of reasons in addition to
monitoring menstruation. Professional athletes, such as those on the U.S.
women's soccer team and several British Olympic hockey gold medalists, use
them to tailor workouts and nutrition plans to their body's cycles. Clue,
Ovia, and Flo say that medical researchers use anonymized information from
the apps to study women&rsquo;s health concerns. Some even have features
that manufacturers claim will help diagnose medical conditions. Flo and Clue
recently introduced tools to assess a user&rsquo;s risk of polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS), a hormone disorder that can affect a woman's fertility.
Period tracker apps are billed as useful tools for people who are trying to
have a baby, want to prevent pregnancy, or need to monitor
menstrual-cycle-related health problems such as hormone-triggered
migraines.&nbsp;</p><h2>Personal information at risk:</h2><p>But to provide
these services, the apps collect deeply personal information that can go
well beyond the dates of your period. Depending on the app, that can include
how often you engage in sexual activity, if you are trying to conceive, and
whether you engage in unprotected sex, have experienced a miscarriage, or
are approaching menopause.</p><h2>Data sharing to third parties and
marketing:</h2><p>Consumer Reports&rsquo; Digital Lab found in a recent
examination of five popular reproductive health tracking
apps&mdash;BabyCenter, Clue, Flo, My Calendar, and Ovia&mdash;that even
anonymous users have no guarantee that their information won&rsquo;t be
shared in some way with third parties for marketing and other
purposes.</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered from <a target="_blank"

<div class="editable mt-3">
<p>We conducted a comparative analysis of 5 reproductive health
&nbsp;tracker apps: BabyCenter, Clue, Flo, My Calendar and Ovia. CR examined
the apps and their privacy policies for clarity and comprehensiveness,
authentication, customer service, data benefits, data privacy, security over
time, governance, threat notifications and overall user
experience.&nbsp;</p><p>To evaluate privacy practices and data security for
BabyCenter, Clue, Flo, My Calendar, and Ovia, CR&rsquo;s Digital Lab used
principles outlined in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard </a>in a
comparative analysis. Launched by CR in 2017 in partnership with privacy and
security experts, the standard is a set of benchmarks that companies can use
to design digital products that are respectful of consumer privacy
rights.</p>

<p>The graphic scorecard illustrates some of the top categories to highlight
throughout the experience.&nbsp;</p><h2><br />Findings reported in CR
article:</h2><p>Consumer Reports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health-privacy/what-your-period-tracker-app-knows-about-you/">reported
the findings through an article</a> that highlighted the apps are popular,
but raises concerns about what happens to the very personal data they
collect. None of the apps guarantee that all of your information will be
used only in ways you intend. That&rsquo;s because they all share some user
data with external partners for purposes such as targeted advertising. And
those partners may then share or resell your personal information to third
parties who make no promises to you about how they handle
it.&nbsp;</p><h2><br />Letter to app companies:</h2><p>CR&rsquo;s Digital
Lab also found shortcomings among all five apps in how they protect the
sensitive user data they gather. The advocacy team <a target="_blank"
rel="noopener"
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPezJ9AQXkecY1pQOO-_3FvDeAZFPkUm/view">wrote
an email</a> that urged these apps to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Only use collected
data for the purpose of the health app;</li><li>Limit the data you collect
to only information needed to operate the app;</li><li>Decline to share or
sell user information;</li><li>Safely destroy collected data once it is no
longer needed to operate the app; and</li><li>Give consumers clear and
concise information about what you do with their data and why.</li><li>When
CR alerted the companies to these findings, some moved quickly to make
fixes.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2><br />Flo app made changes:</h2><p>Flo dropped
Facebook as an ad-tracking and data-analytics partner after <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636">The
Wall Street Journal revealed</a>&nbsp;in February 2019 that the app shared
personal data, such as whether a user intended to become pregnant, with the
social media giant, which used the information for targeted advertising. Now
Flo uses only one partner for ad targeting and app usage analysis while the
other apps CR evaluated use a half-dozen or more.</p><h2>Identified
shortcomings in data collection:</h2><p>While CR&rsquo;s Digital Lab
didn&rsquo;t uncover any major security issues, it did find shortcomings in
the way all five apps handle the sensitive user data they collect, says
Maria Rerecich, CR&rsquo;s senior director of product testing. For example,
none require users to log in by default every time they open the app, or
offer multi-factor authentication (which requires that users input a code
sent by text to their phone), or require an additional security step before
accessing the app.&nbsp;</p>
